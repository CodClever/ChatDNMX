				CHAT DNMX


This is a Chatbot meant to be only used for legal purposes. 
I do not have any relation to Wikipedia or its brands.

There are limitations as it uses Wikipedia as its main search.
This is still under development and should be considered as a beta software.

Please don't hesitate to give credit to me if sharing with anyone.
It would help me a lot.

1.) Download the app from this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Lviz2Lw_DcxeNqyTgicG29mqXcSUvYr4/view?usp=sharing
2.) Install the setup.
3.) Go through the setup very carefully.
4.) Locate ChatDNMX.
5.) Run it as an administrator(Do this every time, this is run as an administrator to create logs for authentication).
