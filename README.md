				CHAT DNMX


This is a Chatbot meant to be only used for legal purposes. 
I do not have any relation to Wikipedia or its brands.

There are limitations as it uses Wikipedia as it's main search.
This is still under development and should be considered as a beta software.

Please don't hesitate to give credit to me if sharing with anyone.
It would help me a lot.


** INSTRUCTIONS ** :-
1.) Download the .zip file.
2.) Locate ChatDNMX_WINDOWS_V6.0_Setup.exe
2.) Open it.
3.) Follow through the process.
4.) It will be installed as an app in your computer.
5.) Locate the app and run it as administrator(Do this everytime, this is run as adminstrator to create logs for authentication).
6.) Enjoy using ChatDNMX



For any problems, you can search on the Internet.

I hope you have fun using it. :)
