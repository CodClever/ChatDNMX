				CHAT DNMX

<h1>Our App:-</h1>
This AI app is an app that gives you access to the latest AI features. (Adding new AI models)
Our team has also **kinda** created our model using Wikipedia and optimized it heavily to adapt
to the user. This is a CLI app and a GUI app is not planned in the future as converting all
the features into a GUI version will take a lot of time. 

<h1>Our Motive:-</h1>
Educated the old and the new people about AI and how to be safe from AI. We are also creating
app for interested people.

<h1>A help:-</h1>
We would appreciate it if someone on the internet helped us with this app and created the 
mobile and the GUI app.
Screenshots of the app would be nice if given to us through email.


I do not have any relation to Wikipedia or its brands.

There are limitations as it uses Wikipedia as its main search. (ChatDNMX)
This is updated monthly and would like to get offers to work with us to optimise the user experience.

Please don't hesitate to give credit to me if sharing with anyone.
It would help me a lot.

<h1>What's New:-</h1>
1. Corrected the spelling mistakes.
2. Created a way where the ChatDNMX will ask you API and directory location when required.
3. Fixed common bugs.
