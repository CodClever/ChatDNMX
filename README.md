<h1>ChatDNMX</h1>


<h1>The App:-</h1>
This AI app is an app that gives you access to the latest AI features. (Adding new AI models)
<br>
Our team has also **kinda** created our model using Wikipedia and optimized it heavily to adapt
<br>
to the user. This is a CLI app and a GUI app is not planned in the future as converting all
<br>
the features into a GUI version will take a lot of time. All the sensitive info are encrypted
<br>
and stored in your machine locally.

<h1>The Motive:-</h1>
Educated the old and the new people about AI and how to be safe from AI. We are also creating
app for interested people.

<h1>A help:-</h1>
We would appreciate it if someone on the internet helped us with this app and created the 
mobile and the GUI app.
<br>
Screenshots of the app would be nice if given to us through email.
<br>
<br>
I do not have any relation to Wikipedia or its brands.
<br>
<br>
There are limitations as it uses Wikipedia as its main search. (ChatDNMX)
<br>
This is updated monthly and would like to get offers to work with us to optimise the user experience.
<br>
<br>
Please don't hesitate to give credit to me if sharing with anyone.
<br>
It would help me a lot.
<br>
<br>
<h1>Upcoming Features and Changes:-</h1>
<br>
1. Corrected the spelling mistakes.
<br><br>
2. Created a way where the ChatDNMX will ask you API and directory location when required.
<br><br>
3. All the sensitive information are encrypted by Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 256-bit Encryption - The Most strongest and most robust encryption standard that is commercially available today.
<br><br>
4. Added new AI models : 1. Gemma by Google on Groq 2. Llama 3 by Meta on Groq 3. Claude 3  Opus 4. Mixtral AI 5. Mixtral AI by Mistral on Groq and Gemini 1.5 AI which is the more improved version and the current version.
   Groq is used for Llama 3 is faster in Grop; for that reason many other AI models are also avaiable in it's Groq version. Groq is faster than normal APIs. 
<br><br>
5. All the upcoming and current AI models; require APIs; so for not getting bankrupted; you have to use your own API(Note that some are paid). We didn't link the API documentation but we did linked the API; where you can get your API, from there you may also find the API documentation as well or search on the web for the details.
<br><br>
6. Fixed common and major bugs/issues.
