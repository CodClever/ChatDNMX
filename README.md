				CHAT DNMX


This is a Chatbot meant to be only used for legal purposes. 
I do not have any relation to Wikipedia or its brands.

There are limitations as it uses Wikipedia as it's main search.
This is still under development and should be considered as a beta software.

Please don't hesitate to give credit to me if sharing with anyone.
It would help me a lot.
