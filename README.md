				CHAT DNMX


This is a Chatbot meant to be only used for legal purposes. 
I do not have any relations to Wikipedia or it's brands.

There is limitations as it is using wikipedia as it's main search.
This is still under development and should be considered as a beta software.

PLEASE give credits to me if sharing to anyone.
Would help me a lot.


** INSTRUCTIONS ** :-
1.) Open the "dist" folder.
2.) Now right-click and click on "Run As Administrator".
3.) Click on "Ok" and give it access to open.
4.) now it will run.



Any problems you can search in the internet.

Have fun using it. :)
