				CHAT DNMX


This is a Chatbot meant to be only used for legal purposes. 
I do not have any relation to Wikipedia or its brands.

There are limitations as it uses Wikipedia as it's main search.
This is still under development and should be considered as a beta software.

Please don't hesitate to give credit to me if sharing with anyone.
It would help me a lot.


** INSTRUCTIONS ** :-
1.) Extract "ChatDNMX.rar".
2.) Open it as administrator.
3.) Now it will run.



For any problems, you can search on the Internet.

I hope you have fun using it. :)
