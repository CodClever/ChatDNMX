<h1>ChatDNMX</h1>


<h1>Our App:-</h1>
This AI app is an app that gives you access to the latest AI features. (Adding new AI models)
<br>
Our team has also **kinda** created our model using Wikipedia and optimized it heavily to adapt
<br>
to the user. This is a CLI app and a GUI app is not planned in the future as converting all
the features into a GUI version will take a lot of time. 

<h1>Our Motive:-</h1>
Educated the old and the new people about AI and how to be safe from AI. We are also creating
app for interested people.

<h1>A help:-</h1>
We would appreciate it if someone on the internet helped us with this app and created the 
mobile and the GUI app.
<br>
Screenshots of the app would be nice if given to us through email.
<br>
<br>
I do not have any relation to Wikipedia or its brands.
<br>
<br>
There are limitations as it uses Wikipedia as its main search. (ChatDNMX)
<br>
This is updated monthly and would like to get offers to work with us to optimise the user experience.
<br>
<br>
Please don't hesitate to give credit to me if sharing with anyone.
<br>
It would help me a lot.
<br>
<br>
